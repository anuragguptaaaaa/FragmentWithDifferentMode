        <item> Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects. It simplifies the software development and maintenance by providing some concepts</item>
        <item>Any entity that has state and behavior is known as an object. For example: chair, pen, table, keyboard, bike etc. It can be physical and logical.</item>
        <item>Collection of objects is called class. It is a logical entity.</item>
        <item>When one object acquires all the properties and behaviours of parent object i.e. known as inheritance. It provides code reusability. It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism.</item>
        <item>When one task is performed by different ways i.e. known as polymorphism. For example: to convince the customer differently, to draw something e.g. shape or rectangle etc.</item>
        <item>Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as abstraction</item>
        <item>Binding code and data together into a single unit is known as encapsulation</item>
